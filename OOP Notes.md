## OOP:

A- Abstract
    - whatever is going on inside, we don't know; pretty well encapsulated; we can leverage pretty well; hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object

P- Polymorphism
    - 2 main waya: method overloading and method overriding (we see this when we leverage inheritance)
    - method overloading is having 2 of the same methods (same name) but both perform differently; one may have no parameters and the other has parameter; different behaviors, same name.
    - overriding is when you have a method from the parent class and a child has the same method, but different behavior

I - Inheritance 
    - a mechanism that allows a new class (subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from an existing class (superclass). This promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes, enabling the subclass to extend or modify the functionality of the superclass

E - Encapsulation
    -  the practice of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, typically a class. This approach helps to hide the internal state of an object and restricts direct access to its components, enhancing security and maintainability. 

- Encapsulation is like having a gumball machine, abstraction is like sticking your hand in a box and not knowing what's going on inside.

- Abstract classes can not be instantiated

- S.O.L.I.D.

- S - single responsibility
- O - open-closed
- L - liskov substitution
- I - interface segregation
- D - dependency inversion
